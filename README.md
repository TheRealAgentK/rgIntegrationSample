Sample app for Summer Of Tech 2018 Kotlin/Android Bootcamp

Downloads if you want to code along with the presenter:

- Install latest version of Android Studio 3.1
- Install all Android SDK & tools for SDK versions 26 and 27 (through Android Studio)
- If not installed, Install the Kotlin plugin in Android Studio - should be on version 1.2.30 or newer
- Install an emulator for Android SDK versions 26 and 27 (through Android Studio) or have an Android phone, thatâ€™s enabled for debugging and development
- Clone this repository

Import the project as a Gradle project in Android Studio, checkout the code from Step 15 and try to build/run it. This should trigger a bit of a lengthy build (3-4 minutes or so) that then will download all the libraries you need.

Regardless if you want to code along or not, it might be a good idea if you clone the code from Github to look at it locally on your machine.
